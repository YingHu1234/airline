## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
The investigation is done through data analysis by using Python scripts. First, data cleaning is performed to narrow down the dataset to three major airline companies for analysis purpose. Then, data accuracy and classification are done using three methods: confusion matrix, Naïve Bayes, and Decision Tree. Lastly, results are analyzed and compared using Chunking, Word Cloud, and Topic Modeling.  


### Prerequisites
SQL, Tableau, Python or Jupyter Notebook

## 🔖 Data Cleaning <a name = "data_leaning"></a>
Data Cleaning
The dataset shown in Figure 1 is downloaded from Kaggle.com.; There are a total of 14 columns, 27284 lines, and no null values. In this dataset, the top 3 of the company are chosen for analysis. They are Air Canada Rouge, British Airways, and United Airlines.

Before the analysis, I used python NLTK, SQL and Tableau to checked the overall reviews about the airline industry,
shows that the word “good” appeared the most in customer reviews, which has almost 16,000 counts.
